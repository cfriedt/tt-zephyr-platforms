    Tenstorrent Blackhole PVT sensor

    PVT stands for process, voltage, and temperature. These bindings are used specifically to
    describe common parts of the top-level multi-function device and to provide a parent reference to
    sub-devices.

    E.g.
    bh_pvt0: bh_pvt@0x80080000 {
      compatible = "tenstorrent,bh-pvt";
      reg = <0x80080000 0x1980>;
      interrupts = <56 1>;
      interrupt-parent = <&intc>;

      ... <sub-device nodes> ...
    };

compatible: "tenstorrent,bh-pvt"
